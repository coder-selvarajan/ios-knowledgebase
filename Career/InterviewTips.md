# Interview Tips

## FAANG Interview Process

Keep this in mind while going for a technical interview with a FAANG company

- Ask clarifying questions
  - They would evaluate how we interact/communicate
- Start with the brute force approach
  - Notify them that you can solve the problem easier with the brute-force approach. This will hint them that you can solve the problem with easier implementation but you are looking for a better performant approach.
- Think out loud.
  - Speak-up your solution step by step.. this will hint them your thought-process
- Let the interviewer guide
  - Interact with the interviewer and walk through the process of arriving the solution. Have fun.
